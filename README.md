# rut
A basic text editor, written in Rust (hence the name).

## Why, though?
I just wanted a basic TUI text editor (like Nano) that could:
- Be used with all major platforms (Linux, Windows, MacOS) by using cross-compatible libraries
- Have the features I miss from more-advanced editors (like multi-cursor in Sublime/VSCode)
- Have great support for third-party plugins
- Be approachable to new terminal users (I'm looking at you, Vim)

## Some more explanation
Largely speaking, this is a project to test my ability to make an actually somewhat-practical application, and it is basically my first "real" foray into UI. I also am doing a collaborative project for the first time.

### Note
This README was written in rut. :)
